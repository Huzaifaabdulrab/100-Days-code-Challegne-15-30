//Question 61: Making Enums for Vehicles: Let's create categories for vehicles like cars, trucks, and motorcycles using enums, and show one example.

enum vehicleType{
    Car,
    Truck,
    Motorcycle
}

// Showing one type of vehicle from the list
console.log(vehicleType.Car); // It shows 0 because enums start counting from 0
// Here, we're just checking what number the Car category got in our list.
